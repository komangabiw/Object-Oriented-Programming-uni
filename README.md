# Learning Object Oriented Programming and GUI Development

This repository showcases a collection of Java programs I developed while learning fundamental programming concepts, GUI development with NetBeans, and database connectivity. These projects highlight my growing expertise in problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and user interface design.

## About My Learning Journey

During my studies, I explored several key areas, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implementing classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Working with arrays, loops, and control structures for efficient logic execution.
- **GUI Development:** Designing user-friendly interfaces using NetBeans and Java Swing.
- **Database Connectivity:** Integrating Java applications with databases to store and manage data dynamically.
- **Game Mechanics & Simulation:** Simulating battles between heroes using OOP principles.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reflection of my learning progress and a stepping stone toward mastering advanced programming topics. I hope it can inspire others to dive into the world of software development!

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in NetBeans or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the Java programs to explore different concepts.
4. Modify and experiment with the code to enhance your understanding.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- NetBeans IDE (or any other Java-compatible IDE)
- MySQL or any relational database (for database-related projects)
